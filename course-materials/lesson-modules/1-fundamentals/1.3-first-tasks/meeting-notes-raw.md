# Product Planning Meeting - Q1 Priorities

jan 15 2025 - zoom call

## who was there
- sarah c (head of product)
- mike r (cto) 
- you (pm - thats me!)
- jordan k (design)
- alex r (pm mobile)
- lisa m (eng lead)

started late bc sarah had internet issues... around 10:15 not 10

## what we talked about

### mobile app status
mike said mobile is going well, should ship by end of q1. ios first then android 2 weeks later. alex is leading. some concerns about notifications - need to decide push vs in-app. lisa said her team can handle the backend but needs specs by friday!! jordan showed mockups, everyone liked them but sarah wants the onboarding flow simplified. too many steps she said.

action: alex to finalize notification approach - push + in-app hybrid?
action: jordan to simplify onboarding from 7 steps to 4
action: lisa needs specs by friday jan 17

### sso implementation
big enterprise deal waiting on this - techcorp ($150k ARR!). mike said its a 6-8 week project. need to decide saml vs oauth or both?? sarah wants both eventually but saml first for this deal. security review needed. 

concerns: 
- dont have saml expertise in house
- might need contractor
- techcorp deadline is march 15

action: mike to scope saml work and identify contractor needs
action: me to get detailed requirements from techcorp

### activation rate stuff
were at 45%, goal is 60%. discussed ideas:
1. better onboarding (jordan has ideas)
2. template library (users keep asking)
3. faster time to first task
4. email sequences (marketing thing)

i showed data - most users drop off after signup before creating first task. average time to first task is 8 minutes but should be under 2. 

"if they dont create a task in the first session theyre probably gone" - mike

action: me to run experiment with simplified first-run experience
action: work with marketing on email nurture sequence

### random stuff that came up
- someone mentioned competitor clickup raised more money
- design system needs updating according to jordan (not urgent)
- bug with notifications on safari - lisa knows about it
- team offsite in march?? sarah to confirm dates

## questions we didnt answer
- what about android timeline? ios first but when android
- whos owning the template library project? 
- do we need to hire for mobile or just contractors?
- whats the actual techcorp deadline - hard or soft?

## next meeting
same time next week - jan 22
sarah to send agenda in advance this time lol

---

my notes after:
feeling good about q1 priorities but worried about sso timeline. techcorp deal is big and we cant miss it. also mike seemed stressed about mobile and sso at same time - resource constraints?

need to follow up with lisa about notification specs - she seemed unclear on requirements
