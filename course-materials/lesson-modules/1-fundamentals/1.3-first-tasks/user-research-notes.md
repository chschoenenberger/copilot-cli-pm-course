# User Research Notes - TaskFlow Onboarding Study

**Research Goal:** Understand why activation rate is only 45% and identify improvements

**Methodology:** 30-minute video interviews with recent signups

---

## Interview 1: Marcus T.

**Background:**
- Role: Project Manager at a marketing agency (35 people)
- Signed up: Jan 8, 2025
- Status: Created account but never completed setup
- Previous tools: Asana, Trello

**Interview Date:** Jan 12, 2025
**Interviewer:** [You]

### Notes:

Started using taskflow because asana got too expensive when we added more people. heard good things on twitter. 

signup was easy but then i got confused. it asked me to create a workspace but i wasnt sure if thats like a project or something else? the terminology was different from what im used to.

"I clicked around for like 5 minutes and then had to jump on a call. Never came back."

asked him what would have helped:
- a quick video showing the basics
- template that looks like what his team does (marketing campaigns)
- import from asana option!!!

"if i could have imported our asana stuff i would have stayed. starting from scratch is too much work when youre busy"

biggest pain with asana was cost ($25/user adds up) and it feels slow lately. would pay $10/user for something simpler.

### Key Quotes:
- "I didn't know what a workspace was supposed to be"
- "Starting from scratch is too much work"
- "If there was a marketing template I probably would have tried it"

## Interview 2: Priya S.

**Background:**
- Role: Engineering Manager at fintech startup (80 people)
- Signed up: Jan 5, 2025
- Status: Completed setup, used for 3 days, then stopped
- Previous tools: Linear, Jira

**Interview Date:** Jan 11, 2025
**Interviewer:** [You]

### Notes:

tried taskflow because linear doesnt have good reporting for managers. i need to see what my team is working on at a glance.

setup was actually fine. created workspace, invited 2 team members to try it. 

problem was github integration. we live in github. if tasks dont connect to PRs its a dealbreaker. saw you have a github integration but it felt basic. linear does this really well.

"We tried it for our sprint but kept having to update things in two places. That killed it."

also the keyboard shortcuts are different from linear. my team complained.

would consider coming back if:
- better github integration (auto-link PRs, status sync)
- keyboard shortcuts that match linear OR are customizable
- team workload view (this is what she really wanted from the start!)

"I'm not asking for linear, I'm asking for linear + better reporting"

### Key Quotes:
- "If tasks don't connect to PRs it's a dealbreaker"
- "We kept having to update things in two places"
- "I'm not asking for linear, I'm asking for linear + better reporting"

## Interview 3: David K.

**Background:**
- Role: Operations Manager at manufacturing company (200 people)
- Signed up: Jan 10, 2025
- Status: Active user! Uses daily
- Previous tools: Spreadsheets, email

**Interview Date:** Jan 13, 2025
**Interviewer:** [You]

### Notes:

first project management tool theyve tried. been using spreadsheets forever. boss finally said we need something better.

"I'm not technical at all. I was nervous about learning a new tool."

loved that taskflow was simple. didnt feel overwhelming like when he looked at monday.com (too many colors and options). 

what made him stay:
- simple enough to understand in first session
- was able to create first task within 2 minutes
- mobile web works (hes on factory floor a lot)

challenges:
- getting his team to adopt (some resistant to change)
- wants offline mode for when hes in areas without wifi
- needs help with permissions (some tasks should be private)

"The people who dont use software for work need something simple. Most tools forget we exist."

would love:
- better mobile app (not just mobile web)
- training videos he can share with team
- templates for manufacturing/operations workflows

### Key Quotes:
- "I'm not technical at all. I was nervous about learning a new tool."
- "Simple enough to understand in first session"
- "The people who don't use software for work need something simple"

## Quick Synthesis (for my reference)

**Why people don't activate (Marcus, Priya):**
1. Terminology confusion (workspace vs project)
2. No import from existing tools
3. Missing key integrations (GitHub)
4. Learning curve with shortcuts/UI

**Why people DO activate (David):**
1. Simplicity (not overwhelming)
2. Fast time to first task
3. Works for non-technical users

**Feature requests mentioned:**
- Import from Asana/other tools
- Better GitHub integration
- Templates (marketing, engineering, ops)
- Offline mode
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Training videos
- Better mobile app
