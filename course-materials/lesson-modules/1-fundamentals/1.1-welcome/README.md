## Meet TaskFlow

**TaskFlow** is your fictional company throughout this course.

**Quick Overview:**
- **What:** Project management SaaS (think Asana meets Linear)
- **Stage:** Series B startup, $20M raised, 50 employees
- **Mission:** Empower remote teams to collaborate seamlessly
- **Your Role:** Senior PM for activation & onboarding
- **Metrics:** $2.5M ARR, 10,000 active users, growing fast

All exercises use real PM work at TaskFlow - PRDs, user research, sprint planning, competitive analysis.

## Exercise 1: Meet Your AI Partner

Let's have a conversation with Copilot CLI.

**Try these prompts:**

```
> Tell me about yourself. What can you help me with as a PM?

> What files do you have access to in this course?

> Summarize the TaskFlow company in 3 sentences.
```

**What you should notice:**
- Copilot can read files in your directory
- It responds naturally to questions
- It has context from the copilot-instructions.md file

---

## Exercise 2: Explore the Company Context

Let's look at the pre-created company files.

**Ask Copilot:**

```
> List the files in the company-context folder

> Read taskflow-overview.md and tell me what my goals are as Senior PM

> Who are the three main user personas at TaskFlow?
```

**Key files to know about:**
| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `taskflow-overview.md` | Company background, your role, OKRs |
| `taskflow-personas.md` | Sarah, Mike, Alex - your users |
| `taskflow-product.md` | Product features, pricing, roadmap |
| `taskflow-competitive.md` | Competitors and positioning |

---

## Exercise 3: Your First Task

Let's do something useful!

**Ask Copilot:**

```
> I need a quick 1-pager on TaskFlow for a new team member joining next week.
> Include: what we do, who our users are, what my role is, and our top priorities.
> Save it to outputs/taskflow-onboarding.md
```

**Check your output:**
- Look in the `outputs/` folder
- Open the file to see what Copilot created

## Key Concepts Learned

### 1. Natural Language Interface

You don't need special commands. Just talk naturally:
- ❌ `/read taskflow-overview.md`
- ✅ "Read the taskflow overview file"

### 2. Context Awareness

Copilot knows about:
- Files in your current directory
- Instructions from copilot-instructions.md
- Your conversation history

### 3. File Operations

Copilot can:
- Read files: "What's in this file?"
- Write files: "Create a file called X"
- Search files: "Find mentions of SSO"
- Modify files: "Update the section on..."

---

## No Coding Required!

This course is designed for PMs. You will NOT need to:
- Write code
- Know terminal commands
- Understand programming

Just talk to Copilot in plain English!

---

## Quick Tips

1. **Be Specific** - "Summarize this in 3 bullet points" > "Summarize this"
2. **Iterate** - "Make it shorter" or "Add more detail about X"
3. **Save Your Work** - Always ask Copilot to save outputs to the `outputs/` folder

---

## Checkpoint ✅

Before moving on, make sure you can:
- [ ] Have a conversation with Copilot CLI
- [ ] Ask it to read files from the course
- [ ] Create and save a new file
