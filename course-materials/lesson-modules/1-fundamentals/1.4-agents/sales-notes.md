# Sales Team Notes - Q4 2024

Compiled feedback from sales team about what customers are asking for.

## Enterprise Deal Feedback

### TechCorp ($150k potential)
- MUST have SSO (SAML)
- Need audit logs for compliance
- Want dedicated support
- Timeline: Q1 close if SSO ready

### DataSystems ($80k potential)
- GitHub integration is critical
- Current: using Linear for this
- Would switch if we had better GitHub sync
- Need: PR linking, status updates, branch info

### GlobalRetail ($200k potential)  
- Multi-workspace support needed
- Want to separate by region
- SSO required
- Also need: custom fields, advanced permissions

---

## Common Objections

1. "You're too small / startup risk"
   - Come up a lot with F500 prospects
   - Need enterprise credibility (SOC2, customer logos)

2. "Missing enterprise features"
   - SSO is #1 blocker
   - Audit logs #2
   - Advanced permissions #3

3. "We're already using X"
   - Switching cost is real
   - Need import tools
   - Need training/onboarding support

---

## Win Themes

When we win, it's usually because:
1. Speed / performance (vs Monday, Asana)
2. Simplicity (vs ClickUp, Jira)
3. Price (vs Asana Enterprise)
4. Modern UI (vs legacy tools)

---

## Loss Analysis

### Lost to Linear (2 deals)
- Both engineering-heavy teams
- Cited: keyboard shortcuts, speed, GitHub integration
- We were close but "Linear just feels better for devs"

### Lost to Asana (1 deal)
- Enterprise buyer
- "Asana is the safe choice"
- They had existing Asana expertise

### Lost to ClickUp (1 deal)
- Wanted "everything in one tool"
- ClickUp's docs + tasks + goals appealed
- We were seen as "just tasks"

---

1. SSO / SAML - 8 requests
2. Better GitHub integration - 6 requests
3. Advanced permissions - 5 requests

## Competitive Intelligence

- Our angle: "Linear + PM features"

### Monday.com
- Performance complaints increasing
- UI overwhelm is real
- Position as "cleaner, faster Monday"
