# Engineering Sync - Jan 9, 2025

Technical discussion with lisa and team.

## performance issues

page load times creeping up (now 2.3s avg, target <1s)
database queries need optimization
redis cache hit rate dropped

"we need to address this before mobile launch or it'll be even worse" - lisa

## technical debt

auth system needs refactor
test coverage at 62%, want 80%
dependency updates overdue

## capacity

team is stretched thin
mobile + SSO at same time is risky
recommend hiring 2 more engineers

action: lisa to create performance improvement plan
action: me to make case for hiring to sarah
