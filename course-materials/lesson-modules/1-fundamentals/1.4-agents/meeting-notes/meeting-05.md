# Design Review - Jan 10, 2025

Review of new designs with jordan.

## onboarding v2

reduced from 7 steps to 4
- step 1: create workspace (was 2 steps before)
- step 2: invite team (optional, can skip)
- step 3: create first task (guided)
- step 4: celebration + next steps

"simpler is better. we were asking too much upfront" - jordan
