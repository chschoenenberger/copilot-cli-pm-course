**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

---

## What You'll Learn

Strategic thinking is what separates good PMs from great ones. You'll learn to:

1. ✅ Conduct competitive analysis
2. ✅ Develop strategic recommendations
3. ✅ Create roadmap narratives
4. ✅ Build executive presentations

---

## The Strategic Challenge

Leadership wants your recommendation for TaskFlow's 2025 strategy focus:

**Question:** Should we focus on:
1. **Enterprise expansion** (SSO, security, compliance)
2. **Product-led growth** (activation, templates, virality)
3. **Platform play** (API, integrations, ecosystem)

You need to analyze the situation and recommend a direction.

---

## Step 1: Gather Strategic Context

Start with what we know.

```
> Help me prepare a strategic analysis by gathering context from course files:
> 
> From company-context/:
> - Our current position (metrics, stage, resources)
> - Our stated OKRs and priorities
> - Competitive landscape
> 
> Summarize the strategic situation in 1 page.
```

---

## Step 2: Competitive Deep Dive

Analyze our competitive position.

```
> Based on the competitive information in taskflow-competitive.md,
> create a strategic competitive analysis:
> 
> 1. Competitive Positioning Map
>    - Plot competitors on value vs. complexity
>    - Identify white space opportunities
> 
> 2. Competitive Threats
>    - Who is most dangerous and why?
>    - What are they doing that we should worry about?
> 
> 3. Competitive Advantages
>    - What do we do better?
>    - What's defensible long-term?
> 
> 4. Strategic Implications
>    - What does this mean for our strategy?
```

---

## Step 3: Analyze Each Option

Evaluate the three strategic directions.

### Option A: Enterprise Expansion

```
> Analyze the "Enterprise Expansion" strategy option:
> 
> What it means:
> - Focus on SSO, security, compliance features
> - Upmarket sales motion
> - Longer sales cycles, bigger deals
> 
> Evaluate:
> - Pros (revenue, defensibility, market position)
> - Cons (resources, complexity, distraction)
> - Required investments
> - Expected outcomes (1 year, 3 year)
> - Risks and mitigations
```

### Option B: Product-Led Growth

```
> Analyze the "Product-Led Growth" strategy option:
> 
> What it means:
> - Focus on activation, templates, virality
> - Self-serve motion
> - High volume, lower touch
> 
> Evaluate:
> - Pros (scale, efficiency, speed)
> - Cons (revenue per user, commoditization)
> - Required investments
> - Expected outcomes (1 year, 3 year)
> - Risks and mitigations
```

### Option C: Platform Play

```
> Analyze the "Platform Play" strategy option:
> 
> What it means:
> - Focus on API, integrations, ecosystem
> - Developer-first approach
> - Build moat through integrations
> 
> Evaluate:
> - Pros (stickiness, ecosystem, differentiation)
> - Cons (complexity, support burden)
> - Required investments
> - Expected outcomes (1 year, 3 year)
> - Risks and mitigations
```

---

## Step 4: Build Recommendation Framework

Create a structured comparison.

```
> Create a strategy comparison matrix:
> 
> | Criteria | Enterprise | PLG | Platform | Weight |
> |----------|-----------|-----|----------|--------|
> | Revenue impact | | | | High |
> | Resource requirements | | | | High |
> | Time to impact | | | | Medium |
> | Competitive moat | | | | High |
> | Risk level | | | | Medium |
> | Team capability fit | | | | Medium |
> | Customer demand | | | | High |
> 
> Score each option 1-5 on each criterion.
> Calculate weighted scores.
> Identify the winning option.
```

---

## Step 5: Develop Your Recommendation

Make your case.

```
> Based on the analysis, develop a strategic recommendation:
> 
> Executive Summary:
> - Recommended strategy (one sentence)
> - Why (three bullets)
> - Key trade-offs acknowledged
> 
> Detailed Rationale:
> - Strategic context
> - Option analysis summary
> - Why this option wins
> - How it connects to our mission
> 
> Implementation Roadmap:
> - Q1 priorities
> - Q2 priorities
> - Key milestones
> - Success metrics
> 
> Risk Mitigation:
> - Top 3 risks
> - How we'll address each
> 
> Save to outputs/strategy-recommendation.md
```

## Step 6: Create Executive Presentation

Package for leadership.

```
> Create an executive presentation outline (for slides):
> 
> Slide 1: Executive Summary
> - Recommendation in one sentence
> - Key metrics we'll impact
> 
> Slide 2: Strategic Context
> - Where we are today
> - Market opportunity
> 
> Slide 3: Options Considered
> - Three options evaluated
> - Why we chose this path
> 
> Slide 4: Competitive Landscape
> - Our position vs competitors
> - How this strengthens us
> 
> Slide 5: Roadmap
> - Q1-Q4 high-level plan
> - Key milestones
> 
> Slide 6: Success Metrics
> - What we'll measure
> - Target outcomes
> 
> Slide 7: Risks & Asks
> - Top risks and mitigations
> - What we need from leadership
> 
> Save to outputs/strategy-presentation-outline.md
```
