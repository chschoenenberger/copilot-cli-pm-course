# Module 2.1: Write a PRD

## Partner with AI to Create Product Requirements Documents

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

---

## What You'll Learn

Writing PRDs is core PM work. You'll learn to:

1. ✅ Structure a professional PRD
2. ✅ Use Copilot for iterative drafting
3. ✅ Get multi-stakeholder feedback
4. ✅ Create comprehensive requirements documents

---

## The TaskFlow PRD Challenge

You've been asked to write a PRD for a new feature: **Task Templates**

**Context from research:**
- Users keep asking for templates (mentioned in 3 interviews)
- Activation rate is 45%, templates could help
- Competitors have this feature
- Q1 priority: improve activation

---

## Step 1: Gather Context

Before writing, gather all relevant information.

```
> I need to write a PRD for a Task Templates feature.
> 
> Help me gather context by:
> 1. Finding all mentions of "templates" in the course files
> 2. Summarizing what users said about templates in research
> 3. Listing our personas and which would benefit most
> 4. Noting any competitor information about templates
```

---

## Step 2: Create Initial Structure

Use the template as a starting point.

```
> Read the prd-template.md file in this folder.
> 
> Create a first draft PRD for Task Templates with:
> - Problem statement based on our research
> - Goals tied to our OKRs (activation rate improvement)
> - Target personas
> - Proposed solution overview
> 
> Don't fill in everything yet - just the structure and key sections.
> Save to outputs/prd-task-templates-draft.md
```

---

## Step 3: Develop User Stories

Now let's add detailed user stories.

```
> Add a User Stories section to the PRD with stories for each persona:
> 
> For Sarah (Enterprise Admin):
> - How would she use templates?
> - What controls does she need?
> 
> For Mike (IC Engineer):
> - How would templates fit his workflow?
> - What templates would he want?
> 
> For Alex (Team Lead):
> - How would templates help his team?
> - What visibility does he need?
> 
> Update the PRD file.
```

---

## Step 4: Define Requirements

Add detailed requirements.

```
> Add a Requirements section with:
> 
> Functional Requirements (what it does):
> - Template creation
> - Template usage
> - Template management
> - Template sharing
> 
> Non-Functional Requirements:
> - Performance (how fast)
> - Security (access control)
> - Scalability (limits)
> 
> Use MoSCoW prioritization (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
> Update the PRD.
```

---

## Step 5: Multi-Stakeholder Review

Get feedback from different perspectives.

### Engineering Review
```
> Review the PRD as a senior engineer. Focus on:
> - Technical feasibility
> - Missing technical details
> - Effort estimates
> - Dependencies and risks
> 
> Add an "Engineering Considerations" section to the PRD.
```

### Design Review
```
> Review the PRD as a UX designer. Focus on:
> - User experience gaps
> - Missing user flows
> - Accessibility considerations
> - Design questions
> 
> Add a "Design Considerations" section.
```

### Business Review
```
> Review the PRD as VP of Product. Focus on:
> - Business impact
> - Success metrics
> - Go-to-market considerations
> - Timeline risks
> 
> Add a "Business Considerations" section.
```

---

## Step 6: Add Metrics & Timeline

Complete the PRD with measurable outcomes.

```
> Add these final sections to the PRD:
> 
> Success Metrics:
> - Primary metric (tied to activation rate)
> - Secondary metrics
> - How we'll measure each
> 
> Timeline:
> - Design phase
> - Development phase
> - QA phase
> - Launch phase
> 
> Risks & Mitigations:
> - Top 3 risks
> - Mitigation strategies
> 
> Open Questions:
> - What needs to be answered before building?
```

---

## Step 7: Final Review & Polish

```
> Review the complete PRD for:
> 1. Consistency - same terminology throughout
> 2. Completeness - all sections filled
> 3. Clarity - no jargon, clear language
> 4. Actionability - clear next steps
> 
> Make any final improvements and save the final version.
```

## PRD Writing Best Practices

### Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Overview | What and why in 2-3 sentences |
| Problem | Pain points with evidence |
| Goals | Measurable objectives |
| User Stories | Persona-specific needs |
| Requirements | What we're building |
| Design | How it looks/works |
| Technical | How it's built |
| Metrics | How we measure success |
| Timeline | When it ships |
| Risks | What could go wrong |

### Dos and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use specific numbers | Use vague language |
| Reference research | Assume everyone knows context |
| Define success metrics | Skip measurement |
| Get multi-stakeholder input | Write in isolation |
| Keep it updated | Let it become stale |

## Checkpoint ✅

Before moving on, make sure you have:
- [ ] A complete PRD for Task Templates
- [ ] User stories for all three personas
- [ ] Multi-stakeholder feedback incorporated
- [ ] Success metrics defined
